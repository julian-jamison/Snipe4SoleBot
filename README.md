Risk Management: Implements stop-loss, profit target, and dynamic risk management features to minimize losses and maximize profits.

Multi-wallet Support: Supports multiple Solana wallets for trading and fund management.

Real-time Market Analysis: Fetches real-time token prices and assesses market volatility to guide trading decisions.

Telegram Integration: Sends real-time trade updates and status notifications through Telegram for better user monitoring.

Error Logging & Backup: Logs trade activities and backs up trade logs to ensure the bot operates efficiently and transparently.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Project Features**
Automated Token Trades: Executes buy and sell operations automatically based on market volatility and user-defined thresholds.

Dynamic Risk Management: Uses volatility thresholds to dynamically adjust trade sizes, stop-loss, and profit targets.

Multi-Wallet Trading: Supports multiple Solana wallets, allowing diversified trading strategies.

Auto-sell on Profit/Stop-Loss: Automatically triggers a sell operation when a token reaches a predefined profit target or stop-loss.

Real-time Price Fetching: Fetches the latest prices from CoinGecko and other DEX APIs to ensure accurate trading decisions.

Telegram Notifications: Sends notifications to a predefined Telegram chat about trade activities, status updates, and errors.

Trade Logging: Logs each trade's details, including timestamps, action type, token address, quantity, price, profit/loss, and status.

Log Backup and Restore: Backs up trade logs regularly to prevent data loss and ensures recovery in case of errors.

## üíª **Project Overview**
Python: Main programming language for bot development.

Solana Python SDK: Library for interacting with the Solana blockchain.

Telegram API: For sending trade updates and messages to Telegram.

Requests: For making HTTP requests to APIs like CoinGecko and Jupiter for price fetching.

Asyncio and Aiohttp: For asynchronous operation and HTTP request handling.

Git LFS: For handling large files within the repository.

Logging: For error and trade logging purposes.

## ‚úÖ **Setup Instructions**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Project to Replit**
1. Create a **new Python Repl** on [Replit](https://replit.com/).
2. Upload all project files.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Dependencies**
Run the following command in the Replit **terminal**:
```sh
pip install pycryptodome python-telegram-bot requests
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Encrypt Your Configuration**
1. Run the encryption script to create `config.enc`:
```sh
python encrypt_config.py
```
2. Delete the original `config.json` file to secure sensitive data:
```sh
rm config.json
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Trading Bot**
Run the following command to start the bot:
```sh
python bot.py
```

---

## üîí **Security & Best Practices**
- **NEVER share `config.enc` or `CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.**
- **Ensure `.gitignore` includes sensitive files** to prevent accidental exposure.
- **Use a VPS (like DigitalOcean) for 24/7 uptime instead of running on Replit.**

## üöÄ **Deploying to DigitalOcean (Step-by-Step)**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a DigitalOcean Droplet**
1. Sign up at [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).
2. Click **"Create"** ‚Üí Select **"Droplets"**.
3. Choose **Ubuntu 22.04 (Recommended)** as the OS.
4. Select the **cheapest plan ($5/month or higher)**.
5. Under **Authentication**, choose **SSH Key** (recommended) or **Password**.
6. Click **"Create Droplet"** and wait for deployment.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Connect to Your DigitalOcean Server**
1. Open a terminal on Replit (or use an SSH client like PuTTY if on Windows).
2. Run the following command to connect (replace with your droplet‚Äôs IP):
```sh
ssh root@your-droplet-ip
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Dependencies on DigitalOcean**
Run the following commands to set up the environment:
```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install python3-pip -y
pip install pycryptodome python-telegram-bot requests
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Clone Your GitHub Repository to the Server**
1. Navigate to your home directory:
```sh
cd ~
```
2. Clone your GitHub repository (replace with your repo URL):
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trading-bot.git
```
3. Move into the project directory:
```sh
cd trading-bot
```

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up and Encrypt Configurations**
1. Run the encryption script to secure `config.json`:
```sh
python encrypt_config.py
```
2. Delete the original `config.json` for security:
```sh
rm config.json
```

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Trading Bot**
Run the bot in the background so it continues running after logout:
```sh
nohup python3 bot.py > bot.log 2>&1 &
```
To check logs:
```sh
tail -f bot.log
```

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Auto-Restart Using systemd (Optional but Recommended)**
1. Create a systemd service file:
```sh
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tradingbot.service
```
2. Add the following content:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=AI Crypto Trading Bot
After=network.target

[Service]
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/root/trading-bot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 bot.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
StandardOutput=append:/var/log/tradingbot.log
StandardError=append:/var/log/tradingbot.log

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
3. Save and exit (`CTRL + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).
4. Reload systemd and enable the service:
```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable tradingbot
sudo systemctl start tradingbot
```
5. Check if the bot is running:
```sh
sudo systemctl status tradingbot
```

‚úÖ **Now, your bot will restart automatically if it crashes or if the server reboots.**
